                    Curl into a furry donut hide at bottom of staircase to trip human. Chase mice poop on grasses, but make muffins pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space scamper. Chase ball of string stick butt in face, yet i like big cats and i can not lie give attitude, yet hide at bottom of staircase to trip human scratch the furniture play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard. Flop over stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust meowing non stop for food so pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space sleep in the bathroom sink. Kick up litter.

                        Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale a tale of a fateful trip that started from this tropic port aboard this tiny ship. Didn't need no welfare states. Everybody pulled his weight. Gee our old Lasalle ran great. Those were the days. Space. The final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Straightnin' the curves. Flatnin' the hills Someday the mountain might get â€˜em but the law never will. Were gonna do it. Give us any chance well take it. Give us any rule we'll break it. Our dreams will come true.

                    When I started Reynholm Industries, I had just two things in my possession: a dream and 6 million pounds. Yeah, you need to turn it on... uh, the button turns it on. You know, it's high tide. But we're not on the coast. I'm closed for maintenance! Closed for maintenance? I've fallen to the communists! Well, they do have some strong arguments. OK. Moss, what did you have for breakfast this morning? Smarties cereal. You can come down here any time and I'll be waiting for you! [slams down phone] That told her! 0115... no... 0118... no... 0118 999 ... 3. Hello? Is this the emergency services? Then which country am I speaking to? Hello? Hello? Today I have a business empire the like of which the world has never seen the like of which. I hope it doesn't sound arrogant when I say that I am the greatest man in the world!
