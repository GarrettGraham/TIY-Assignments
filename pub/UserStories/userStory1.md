BREAD - for a focused user story in general
CRUD aspects are the bullet points

User stories are functionality specifications

the way you phrase the user story ... write the user story specific to the seller vs. relative to the buyer: its the perspective of the audiance. Etsy is geared toward buyers


* What types of smurfs? you have shoppers and buyers
* everyone who uses the application is a user

filter out the user stories you dont understand: following the brain-storm session


# A Shopper can browse Products so that Sellers can Sell Products

# A Shopper can Browse the products so that the buyers can find something that they like

# A Shopper/buyer can Browse Products by category so that the shopper can narrow their search options.

# A focused shopper...narrow down choices of products that relates to a specific Category 


we want our application to be responsive but does not apply to the story in general -- this is a CRUD option
    
    --> what are the breakpoints?!?!?
    --> bullet points related to responsive design and
        viewport size
    --> heading of user can Browse products

# A Shopper can view thumbnails so that Shopper can view Product Details

    * Selecting options for a Product is a part of Placing an order
    * adding a Line Item to an order: 

# A Shopper can view Details of that Product so that the Shopper can better understand the Product
    * what are the details that will be displayed to the Shopper? reviews, product options, price, name,
        * whatever can be found within t
        * what will be shown in the grid will go into bullet points...
        * the Benefit is for the Shoppers: shoppers are the highest priority for e-commerce.
        * Shopper orietented perspective.
    * what are we going to present to a Shopper when theyre browsing. 
    * Present to Shopper the Product:name price picture description
    !!want one click to add to product or one click to checkout!!
        
Browse story
    * put product details OF browse mode HERE

Sellers can add images at any point in time...

break up user stories into bullet points or make new user stories

list of images is an array of objects: thumbnails and full images. every item within the images array must be thick...everything you would need to create an img tag.

product options


    The backlog of user stories continue to grow as the project continues! always re-assess the user stories periodically throughout 
    
# A Shopper can add products to their shopping cart...(EPIC!)
