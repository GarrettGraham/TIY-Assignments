                            Hi boys. I'm Tina. I texted back a smiley face. She texted back some letters I don't understand. 
                            Explore the morgue? I'm gonna write the most erotic, graphic, freakiest friend fiction ever. 
                            I'm compiling a list of people I can mate with to repopulate the Earth. I texted back a smiley face. 
                            She texted back some letters I don't understand. Gene, you saved us. I owe you my life. 
                            I guess she doesn't like wearing clothes. How do you know a python ate it? Did it leave a note? 
                            This is such a snore-gasm. If we see any mermaids, I'm gonna ask them where their merginas are. 
                            I guess she doesn't like wearing clothes. The hand wants what the hand wants. Sausage leather belts. 
                            Not if you're a fish.

                        <p>
                            You're Killing Me, Buster. A Colombian cartel that WON'T kidnap and kill you. First I blow him, then I poke him. If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. Te quiero. English, please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. I'm not a prostitute. Then I shall let you live! Although George Michael had only got to second base, he'd gone in head first, like Pete Rose.
                            It's as Ann as the nose on plain's face. A sea of waiters and no one will take a drink order. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! Michael: And yet you didn't notice her body? Gob: I like to look in the mirror. Dad would stage elaborate situations using a one-armed man to teach us lessons. I mean, it's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars? Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape horn? 
                            Oh, I can just taste those meaty leading man parts in my mouth. You just grab that brownish area by its points and you don't let go no matter what your mother tells you! There's a new daddy in town. A discipline daddy. Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar.
                            A flower in my garden, a mystery in my panties. Got a big ass room at the travelodge. What a fun, sexy time for you.God knows they're squinters. Get rid of the Seaward. Lucille: I'll leave when I'm good and ready. She's not that Mexican, Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Columbian or something. What a fun, sexy time for you. OH MY GOD, WE'RE HAVING A FIRE… sale. Oh, the burning! ♪♪ Amaaaaaaziiiing Graaaace ♪♪ 
                            So Ann, the question is, do you want a man or a boy? I know how I would answer. Mom always taught us to curl up in a ball and remain motionless when confronted. So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! That was Tom Cruise, the actor. They said he was some kind of scientist. Do you have any idea how often you say the word "afraid"? Well, I know I used it in the Jacuzzi. The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON.
